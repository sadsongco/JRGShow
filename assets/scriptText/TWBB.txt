FADE IN:

EXT. HIGHWAY. - EVENING
We swoop over ambulances and police cars forcing their way
through the built up traffic, still some distance from the
scene of an ACCIDENT. There is some space around a large truck,
as if the cars are keeping a bowed-head respectful distance
from tragedy. Tyre marks are burned into the asphalt and sprinkled
 with evidence of the mayhem that led up to the final impact. We
 close in on the CAR that’s wedged under the back corner of the
 truck. Whoever was in the driver’s seat had no chance - that side
 of the car is crushed into nothing. But we sweep round to the smashed
 passenger window, and see matted blond hair, and a face streaked with
 blood rolled to one side.

INT. BEDROOM OF LAURA'S APT - MORNING

PATRICK and LAURA are in bed together. It’s a Sunday morning (after
a Saturday night of multiple helpings of coffee) vibe. PATRICK has
obviously become something of a fixture.
