CAMERA looks up a steep trail. Half the frame filled with a
hill in close distance, the other half is sky... over the top of
the hill we see a prospector's pick come up and down... up and

ANGLE. BEHIND THE MAN WITH THE PICK.
DANIEL C. PLAINVIEW (late 30's here) is, with pick and ax,
in the middle of the day, in 110 degree heat in New Mexico,

He has a shaft about fifteen feet deep at this point.
Nearby is a MULE and a CART. He digs and digs and digs.
