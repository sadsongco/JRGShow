# Lighting Designer Visualiser
This is my final major project for my BSc in Computer Science with Goldsmiths University Of London. An early prototype was used to create visuals for a festival show for Jonny Greenwood in 2021. It then continued to be developed for the CM3070 Final Project module.

It's browser based as stupulated by the project template, and uses various web technologies, such as Web Workers (for image manipulation), IndexedDB (for local data storage) and Broadcast Channels (for communication between the control window and the visualiser output).
